# DPDPA Feature Mapping (Prototype)

 Consent management: CRUD APIs, audit logging, cache → Sections on Consent
 Children’s data: age verification + guardian consent → Children’s data processing
 Policy enforcement: OPA rules (consent, minor) → Processing restrictions
 Rights: access/erase endpoints (stubbed orchestration) → Data principal rights
 Breach notification: notifier service skeleton + template → Breach reporting
 Retention: scheduler skeleton → Data retention
 Audit & verifiability: Merkle-based inclusion proofs → Accountability
